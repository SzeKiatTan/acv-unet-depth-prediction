# Depth Estimation Using U-NET

---
<br>

Using a 5-block U-Net architecture; this project aims to estimate depth from a single monocular image.
<br><br>

The dataset used for training and evaluation is the **[NYU Depth V2](https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html)** labelled set [1], consisting of 1449 densely labeled pairs of aligned RGB and depth images.
